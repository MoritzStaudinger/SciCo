We move away from the popular one-for-all multilingual models and focus on training multiple language (family) specific representations, but most prominently enable all languages to still be encoded in the same representational space. We focus on teacher-student training, allowing all encoders to be mutually compatible for bitext mining, and enabling fast learning of new languages. We also combine supervised and self-supervised training, allowing encoders to take advantage of monolingual training data.Our approach significantly outperforms the original LASER encoder. We study very low-resource languages and handle 44 African languages, many of which are not covered by any other model. For these languages, we train sentence encoders and mine bitexts. Adding these mined bitexts yielded an improvement of 3.8 BLEU for NMT into English.",

Despite these advancements, there exists a critical challenge: These models can inadvertently generate content that is toxic, inaccurate, and unhelpful, and existing automatic evaluation metrics often fall short of identifying these shortcomings. As models become more capable, human feedback is an invaluable signal for evaluating and improving models. This survey aims to provide an overview of recent research that has leveraged human feedback to improve natural language generation. First, we introduce a taxonomy distilled from existing research to categorize and organize the varied forms of feedback. Next, we discuss how feedback can be described by its format and objective, and cover the two approaches proposed to use feedback (either for training or decoding): directly using feedback or training feedback models. We also discuss existing datasets for human-feedback data collection, and concerns surrounding feedback collection. Finally, we provide an overview of the nascent field of AI feedback, which uses large language models to make judgments based on a set of principles and minimize the need for human intervention. We also release a website of this survey at feedback-gap-survey.info.",

        "paper1_abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations in\nquestion-answering (QA) tasks when faced with ambiguous questions. Users often\nassume that LLMs share their cognitive alignment, a mutual understanding of\ncontext, intent, and implicit details, leading them to omit critical\ninformation in the queries. However, LLMs generate responses based on\nassumptions that can misalign with user intent, which may be perceived as\nhallucinations if they misalign with the user's intent. Therefore, identifying\nthose implicit assumptions is crucial to resolve ambiguities in QA. Prior work,\nsuch as AmbigQA, reduces ambiguity in queries via human-annotated\nclarifications, which is not feasible in real application. Meanwhile, ASQA\ncompiles AmbigQA's short answers into long-form responses but inherits human\nbiases and fails capture explicit logical distinctions that differentiates the\nanswers. We introduce Conditional Ambiguous Question-Answering (CondAmbigQA), a\nbenchmark with 200 ambiguous queries and condition-aware evaluation metrics.\nOur study pioneers the concept of ``conditions'' in ambiguous QA tasks, where\nconditions stand for contextual constraints or assumptions that resolve\nambiguities. The retrieval-based annotation strategy uses retrieved Wikipedia\nfragments to identify possible interpretations for a given query as its\nconditions and annotate the answers through those conditions. Such a strategy\nminimizes human bias introduced by different knowledge levels among annotators.\nBy fixing retrieval results, CondAmbigQA evaluates how RAG systems leverage\nconditions to resolve ambiguities. Experiments show that models considering\nconditions before answering improve performance by $20\\%$, with an additional\n$5\\%$ gain when conditions are explicitly provided. These results underscore\nthe value of conditional reasoning in QA, offering researchers tools to\nrigorously evaluate ambiguity resolution.",

However, the\nexploration of fairness within VLM applications remains limited. Applying VLMs\nwithout a comprehensive analysis of fairness could lead to concerns about equal\ntreatment opportunities and diminish public trust in medical deep learning\nmodels. To build trust in medical VLMs, we propose Fair-MoE, a model\nspecifically designed to ensure both fairness and effectiveness. Fair-MoE\ncomprises two key components: \\textit{the Fairness-Oriented Mixture of Experts\n(FO-MoE)} and \\textit{the Fairness-Oriented Loss (FOL)}. FO-MoE is designed to\nleverage the expertise of various specialists to filter out biased patch\nembeddings and use an ensemble approach to extract more equitable information\nrelevant to specific tasks. FOL is a novel fairness-oriented loss function that\nnot only minimizes the distances between different attributes but also\noptimizes the differences in the dispersion of various attributes'\ndistributions. Extended experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and fairness\nof Fair-MoE. Tested on the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset, Fair-MoE showed\nimprovements in both fairness and accuracy across all four attributes. Code\nwill be publicly available.",

Spatio-temporal\ndata, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and\ntime, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently,\ndiffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and\nspatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and\ninferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend\nto other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly\nreview the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data,\ncategorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical\napplication domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into\nunconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series and spatio-temporal\ndata separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are\nsubdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive\nand generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification,\nand imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra\ninformation to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both\npredictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their\napplication in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate,\nenergy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of\nhow these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview,\nwe aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive\nunderstanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data\nanalysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing\ntraditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion\nmodel framework.",

        "paper1_abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have democratized synthetic data generation,\nwhich in turn has the potential to simplify and broaden a wide gamut of NLP\ntasks. Here, we tackle a pervasive problem in synthetic data generation: its\ngenerative distribution often differs from the distribution of real-world data\nresearchers care about (in other words, it is unfaithful). In a case study on\nsarcasm detection, we study three strategies to increase the faithfulness of\nsynthetic data: grounding, filtering, and taxonomy-based generation. We\nevaluate these strategies using the performance of classifiers trained with\ngenerated synthetic data on real-world data. While all three strategies improve\nthe performance of classifiers, we find that grounding works best for the task\nat hand. As synthetic data generation plays an ever-increasing role in NLP\nresearch, we expect this work to be a stepping stone in improving its utility.\nWe conclude this paper with some recommendations on how to generate\nhigh(er)-fidelity synthetic data for specific tasks.",

Now, as AI technologies\nenter our everyday lives at an ever increasing pace, there is a greater need\nfor AI systems to work synergistically with humans. One critical requirement\nfor such synergistic human-AI interaction is that the AI systems be explainable\nto the humans in the loop. To do this effectively, AI agents need to go beyond\nplanning with their own models of the world, and take into account the mental\nmodel of the human in the loop. Drawing from several years of research in our\nlab, we will discuss how the AI agent can use these mental models to either\nconform to human expectations, or change those expectations through explanatory\ncommunication. While the main focus of the book is on cooperative scenarios, we\nwill point out how the same mental models can be used for obfuscation and\ndeception. Although the book is primarily driven by our own research in these\nareas, in every chapter, we will provide ample connections to relevant research\nfrom other groups.",
