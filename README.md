# SciCo: A Dataset for Institutional and Publication Level Comparisons of Scientific Contributions

**SciCo** is a novel dataset designed for structured, comparative analysis of scientific publications and institutions. It combines full-text research papers with rich metadata (including author affiliations, countries, topics, and more) to enable query-driven multi-document comparisons across institutions and publication venues. SciCo is particularly suited for benchmarking contributions, tracking topic evolution, and exploring overlaps in research agendas.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of:
- **Corpus file** (JSON): Full-texts with detailed metadata for 12,610 unique publications (2015â€“2025).
- **Question files** (JSON): 97 curated queries to guide comparative analyses (e.g., comparing universities, summarizing institutional contributions, tracking topic trends).

```

### Example Query
```json
